# Exploratory-Data-Analysis: Using statistics to gain insight and create visualizations about three species of flower

# Background 
There are four variables used to describe the three species of Iris in the dataset. Sepal Width, Sepal Length, Petal Length, and Petal Width are the features used to distinguish the species ( <em>Iris setosa, Iris, viginica,</em> and <em> Iris versicolor</em>)

# Objective
This project's purpose is to demonstrate ability to perform a preliminary investigations of the Iris data in order to discover trends, anomalies, check assumptions with the help of statistical insight and graphic representations. 

***Quick Questions:***
- What statistical insight can I gain from this dataset (ex. mean, median, standard deviation, count, min, max)?
- What can I learn about the data frame (number of variables, number of rows/columns)?
- How are the species differentiated by their variables?

# Dataset Background
Downloaded the [Iris dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/himanshunakrani/iris-dataset) from Kaggle that contains information about petal and sepal dimensions for three species of Iris.
